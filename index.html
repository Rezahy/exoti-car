					What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being
					a sports car.
				</h3>
				<p class="article-text">
					A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door
					automobile designed for spirited performance and nimble handling. The
					term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919. According to
					USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term
					was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and
					light weight are requisite. Sports cars are usually aerodynamically
					shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared to
					standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for
					precise control at high speeds.Traditionally sports cars were open
					roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become popular during the
					1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is
					not absolute.

					Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.
				</h3>
				<p class="article-text">
					Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and
					early sporting regulations often demanded four seats (even
					three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became
					common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have
					small back seats that are often really only suitable for luggage or
					small children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full
					seats + two "occasional" seats).
				</p>
				<p class="article-text">
					Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to
					increase the practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating
					room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of the
					car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and
					slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered
					for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical because of the
					difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the
					design in their F1.
